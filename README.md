# PDF-AND-IMAGE-TOOLS
A tool for converting between PDF to image and image formats.
## Introduction
The core function of the software is implemented based on ImageMagick's Magick++, and the graphical interface is based on the MFC framework. Its main function is to achieve high-quality conversion between PDF to image and image formats.

### This is an impromptu rough little program, the code is badly written, and the functions can only be used as needed.
